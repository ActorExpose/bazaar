harassment of any kind will result in sanctions, including permanent exclusion from the community. Do not insist when
somebody declines a solicitation. If you are accused of oppressive or hurtful behavior, excuse yourself and try to understand
what the issue was. If you are harassed or face discrimination, or if you witness harassment or discrimination toward other
people, or if you fear an incident occurring during Pithus’s activities, you can contact `pandora [at] pithus [dot] org`.
Every report done in good faith will be taken seriously.
